# Advent of Code 2024

This repository contains my solutions for the [Advent of Code 2024](https://adventofcode.com/2024) challenges. Each day presents a new programming puzzle, and this repository is organized to reflect the solutions for each day.

## Structure

Each day's solution is stored in its own folder, with separate files for each part of the challenge and an input file:

├── day-01/
│ ├── part1.js
│ ├── part2.js
│ └── input.txt
├── day-02/
│ ├── part1.js
│ ├── part2.js
│ └── input.txt
├── day-03/
│ ├── part1.js
│ ├── part2.js
│ └── input.txt
├── day-04/
│ ├── src/
│ │ └── index.js
│ └── input.txt
├── ...
└── README.md



- **part1.js**: Contains the solution for the first part of the day's challenge.
- **part2.js**: Contains the solution for the second part of the day's challenge.
- **index.js**: Contains the solution for Day 4's challenge.
- **input.txt**: Contains the input data for the day's challenge.

## How to Run

2. **Navigate to the day's folder**:  
   Change directory to the specific day's folder you want to run:
   ```bash
   cd day-04/src
   ```

3. **Run the solution**:  
   Use Node.js to run the solution files. For example, to run Day 4:
   ```bash
